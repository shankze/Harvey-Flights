##THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Analysis of how Houston airports (IAH and HOU) and Houston bound airlines handled the storm Harvey. I do an in-depth analysis of the schedules, how early airlines cancelled flights, where and why did they divert and how did quickly did they ramp-up operations after Harvey.
